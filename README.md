This is a custom firmware for Atmel controller based Control Board made for Dishwasher (Electrolux/Hobart hood type). It uses the Atmel Studio for ATMEGA328P and a number of 3rd party libraries. 

## Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to Dishwasher development. You can contribute to the repository by doing:

* Pull requests (fixes, enhancements, new features... are very welcome)
* Documentation (I reckon I'm bad at it)
* Testing (filing issues or help resolving them, they take a lot of time and sometimes I don't have the required hardware to test them all)

And of course you can always buy me a beer, coffee, tea,... via the donation button below.
